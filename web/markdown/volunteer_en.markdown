## Volunteering at PyCon Canada 2016

We're all looking forward to the great conference in November -the organizing team is working hard to make this happen, but we can't do it alone.

Volunteers **must be registered** to volunteer, but we welcome **all attendees** to lend a hand. We much appreciate any assistance you can give us.
